<p>You must write a program that finds the length of the maximal increasing sequence in an array of N integers. </p>
<p>But you must find the maximal increasing sequence from the first element in the sequence. </p>
Example:
<p>If we have <strong>int array [123, 321, 1, 3, 2, 4, -1 ] </strong>=> the max sequence is <strong>1, 3, 2, 4 </strong>
not 1, 3 because we compare elements from the first element in the sequence
