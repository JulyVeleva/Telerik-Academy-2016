You must write a program that finds the length of the maximal increasing sequence in an array of N integers. 
But you must find the maximal increasing sequence from the first element in the sequence.
Example:
If we have int array [123, 321, 1, 3, 2, 4, -1 ] => the max sequence is 1, 3, 2, 4 
not 1, 3 because we compare elements from the first element in the sequence
